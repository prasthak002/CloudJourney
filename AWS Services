    ==> Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS if you just need virtual private servers. Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly – a virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP – for a low, predictable price. After you create your instance, you can easily connect to it. You can manage your instances using the Lightsail console, Lightsail API, or Lightsail command line interface (CLI).
